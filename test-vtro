New users can be created in two ways:

From the command line.
Through the GUI.
Adding a User from the Command Line
In Ubuntu, there are two command-line tools that you can use to create a new user account: useradd and adduser.

useradd is a low-level utility. adduser is a script written in Perl that acts as a friendly interactive frontend for useradd.
